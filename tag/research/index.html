            <p>My research interests lie in understanding fundamental principles about biological systems through the laws of Physics. 
              I’m particularly interested in understanding how information flows through biological networks - as related to both the structure, and the function of a given network. 
              I’m also interested in understanding the scaling laws that are ubiquitous in biological systems - from developmental patterning, to large ecological systems.</p>

              <p>I briefly sketch the projects I’ve worked on, and my interests here.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Biological Oscillators</h2>
        </header>

	<section class="post-content">
		<p>Most living organisms have periodic processes that help them anticipate recurring events or changes in the environments. 
    The most familiar of these is probably circadian rhythms - commonly known as the sleep-wake cycle. 
    Oscillatory processes occur in organisms cross many species, and many orders of magnitude of time periods. 
    From neuronal oscillations, which an occur on a timescale of a few ms, to the cell-cycle which occurs on timescales from minutes to days, 
    to circannual clocks, which are approximately a year long cycle, oscillatory process permeate biological systems.</p>
    
    <p>When biologists look at the diverse processes and timescales over which temporal rhythms occur, they find that certain biochemical network topologies are evolutionarily selected. 
    It has long been understood that free-running oscillations require feedback loops where the activity of one component depends on the concentration of another. 
    Oscillator motifs have been classified by the positive or negative net logic of these loops. Most studies regarding network topologies focus on the statistics of these network motifs.  
    However, each feedback loop can be implemented by regulation of either the production step or the removal step. These possibilities are not equivalent because of the underlying structure of biochemical kinetics.</p>

    <p>By computationally searching over these possibilities, we find that certain molecular implementations are much more likely to produce stable oscillations. 
    These preferred molecular implementations are found in many natural systems, but not typically in artificial oscillators, suggesting a design principle for future synthetic biology.</p> 

    <p>Finally, we develop an approach to oscillator function across different reaction networks by evaluating the biosynthetic cost needed to achieve a given phase coherence. 
    We find that noise-induced oscillations can occur at low copy numbers. This analysis predicts that phase drift is most efficiently suppressed by delayed negative feedback lo op architectures that operate without positive feedback.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Theoretical Ecology</h2>
        </header>
      
  <section class="post-content">
		<p>Ecological systems are extremely resilient to perturbations. 
      Since Robert May’s ground-breaking work on ecological networks and their stability, 
      ecologists have invested in understanding how stability emerges in complex, multi-species systems. 
      However, while coarse-grained models are extremely tractable for understanding the stability of systems, 
      they fail to provide mechanisms of species interactions, and the emerging stability. Detailed models of interactions of a large ecosystem quickly becomes intractable.</p> 

      <p>With Prof. James O’Dwyer, I’m interested in working on the intermediate range, with coarse-grained consumer-resource models to understand how species 
      interact with each other. In particular. we are interested in the geometry of the structural stability space of interacting species and resources.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Cell-Cell Communication</h2>
  </header>
      
	<section class="post-content">
		<p>Multicellular organisms start as single-cell entities, which divide symmetrically initially. 
      Then, developmental cues led to directionality in the embryos. Pattern formation scales with organism size - meaning, 
      a larger fly will have commensurately larger organs and systems. This happens reliably, despite differences in initial gene transcription levels, 
      and stochasticity.</p>

      <p>Typically, ligand gradients bind to proteins to convey positional information, and in some cases, determine cell fates. 
      The asymmetry introduced by small ligand gradients is theorized to be amplified by cell-cell communication and feedback during development. 
      I’m interested in understanding the gene regulatory networks that give rise to robust developmental patterning, and the associated scaling laws. 
      I’m also interested in understanding what the minimal amount of information that needs to be transmitted through gene regulatory networks such 
      that developmental signals are transmitted with minimal error.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Analogue Gravity</h2>
  </header>
      
	<section class="post-content">
		<p>Analogue Gravity, as the name suggests, is any system that is analogous to a gravitational system. A simple example is sound waves travelling in a 
      fluid flowing in a tube with a constriction, where before the constriction the velocity of the fluid is lower than the speed of sound n the fluid, 
      and after the constriction, the velocity of the fluid flow is greater than the speed of sound in the fluid. As the fluid drags the sound waves with it, 
      this system creates an acoustic black hole, such that the sound waves can ravel only with the fluid in the region where \v_{fluid} > v_{sound}\).</p> 

      <p>Similarly, using Bose-Einstein condensates, Unruh showed that the quantized linear fluctuations around the condensate state can be recast as a space-time metric. 
      This formalism can be used to study Hawing Radiation in tabletop systems. As hawking’s result in astronomical systems is not validated beyond 
      doubt (due to his assumptions that do not acount for the effects at the Plank scale), analogue systems whose microscopic theories are well known are 
      used to gain insights into astronomical systems which are untenable for experimentation.</p>

      <p>We develop a framework where hawing radiation in analogue systems can be treated as a scattering problem, with modulated amplitudes. 
      A simple model turns out to capture many characteristics of the astronomical black hole system.</p>
